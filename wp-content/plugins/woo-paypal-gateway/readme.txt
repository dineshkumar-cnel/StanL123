= How to get phone numbers for PayPal Checkout orders?=

If you use PayPal Checkout, then you might have noticed that the checkout page does not contain the customer's phone number. If you have a PayPal business account, then you can require customer phone numbers from your PayPal account settings.

PayPal has the ability to provide the customer’s phone number which can be used to autopopulate your checkout page. We recommend you enable this option as it reduces the number of checkout fields your customer has to manually enter. It reduces friction and will improve conversion rates.
